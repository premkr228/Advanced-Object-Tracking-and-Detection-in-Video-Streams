# Advanced-Object-Tracking-and-Detection-in-Video-Streams
Developed an end-to-end multi-object tracking system using Faster R-CNN for pedestrian detection and SORT (Kalman Filter + Hungarian matching) for identity tracking. Evaluated on MOT17 with mAP, MOTA, IDF1, precision, and recall. Achieved stable temporal consistency across 600 video frames.
